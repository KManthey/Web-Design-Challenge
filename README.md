Web-Design-Challenge

The goal is to provide a web-based visualization via GitHub pages for previous weather data.
The website is responsive for differing viewing options

The website consists of 7 pages total, including:
* An initial landing page which explains the project and links to individual pages.  Clicking images in the sidebar
will take the user to that visualization page.

* Four individual visualization pages

* A Comparison with the four visualization pages on one page for comparison purposes.

* A Data page displays the data used for the project.  This data is converted from a csv to a pandas dataframe then to an HTML.
